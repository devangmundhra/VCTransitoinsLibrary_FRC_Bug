VCTransitoinsLibrary_FRC_Bug
============================

Repository to demonstrate a bug in https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/VCTransitionsLibrary

This repository contains a project directly from Apple's CoreDataBooks examples with slight modifications (using Transitions between View Controllers, using Modal transitions instead of navigation push).

The issue is that when dismissing a view controller, if it is dismissed half way, it shows an artifact as demonstrated in this example.
